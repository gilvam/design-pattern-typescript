## Bridge pattern 
### Decouples abstraction and implementation and allows both to vary independently.

#### Use this pattern when :

* Abstractions and implementations have not been decided at compile time
* Abstractions and implementations should be changed independently
* Changes in implementation of abstraction should not affect caller application
* Client should be insulated from implementation details.
